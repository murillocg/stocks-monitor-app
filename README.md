### Workflow

#### Create a daily job to request all stock prices for the current day
Every weekday a job is triggered in the evening 4PM BRT
- It goes to WalletTable and request the prices/quotes for each stock in this table
- Saving the regularPrice and date time for each stock in the StockPrices
- TDB: What about the highest price? I need the regular price to compare and likely to need the date when this happened
- Publish an event saying that DailyStockPricesUpdated

#### Stocks that dropped over than 15% since their highest price - Check daily
Whenever the DailyStockPricesUpdated was triggered
- Go to WalletTable and for each stock in this table
- If the today's price is lower than the highest price in 15%, add this stock to alertList
- If there is at least one stock in the alertList, send this list by email or another way

#### % gain/loss in the last week - Check weekly
Create a weekly job to runs every friday in the evening 4PM BRT
